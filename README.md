## Project's key goals:
- Using area codes, combine datasets from multiple locations into a single dataset.
- Data pre-processing to replace null and out-of-bounds values.
- Data training with the chosen machine learning models.
- Choosing the most accurate model and putting it into practice for this dataset.
