# Heart Disease Analysis using R

## Overview
This project focuses on analyzing a heart disease dataset to gain insights into factors that contribute to the presence of heart disease. By leveraging R and various statistical and machine learning techniques, we aim to understand patterns, identify risk factors, and build predictive models to assist in diagnosing heart disease.

## Project Objectives
- Conduct exploratory data analysis to gain a comprehensive understanding of the heart disease dataset.
- Perform data preprocessing and cleaning, including handling missing values and outliers.
- Visualize the data to identify any notable trends or patterns.
- Analyze the relationship between different variables and the presence of heart disease.
- Develop and evaluate predictive models using various machine learning algorithms.
- Assess the performance of the models and identify the most effective approach for heart disease prediction.

# Dataset Description
The heart disease dataset used in this project consists of various attributes such as age, sex, cholesterol levels, blood pressure, and the presence or absence of heart disease. The dataset provides a rich set of features for analysis and model development

There are 3 available databases concerning heart disease diagnosis. All attributes are numeric valued. The data was collected from the 3 following locations:
Cleveland Clinic Foundation
Hungarian Institute Of Cardiology
University Hospital, Switzerland

The dataset has 14 attributes (categorical, Integer and Real) and 720 instances. The ’num’ attribute is the response variable, used for the prediction.

## Project's key goals
- Using area codes, combine datasets from multiple locations into a single dataset.
- Data pre-processing to replace null and out-of-bounds values.
- Data training with the chosen machine learning models.
- Choosing the most accurate model and putting it into practice for this dataset.
